# Endsmart

A replacement for the [endwise extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kaiwood.endwise) with the same objective: be able to intelligently add `end` statements when needed to Ruby blocks.

Compared to endwise, this extension tries to use more modern VSCode APIs rather than low-level commands processing. The end result remains the same but has better performance characteristics and generally behaves better in [remote development scenarios](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) by reducing typing latency.

## Contributing

This extension is voluntarily kept fairly simple and focused on doing its core job well. As a result we do not expect a tremendous amount of extra changes to be needed.

However contributions and feedback to this extensions are still welcome, so please open issues for feature requests, questions and alike.
